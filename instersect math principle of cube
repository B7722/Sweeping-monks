ray of inght  intersects the cubeï¼š

For the ray p (t) = e + td and the surface equation of the cube f (p) = 0, when the ray intersects the surface then the p must satisfy the surface equation:
f(p(t))=0 or (e+td)=0;
for a cube, there are six surfance equations because one cube has six surfaces, and we can use Normal vector and the points in one surface to represent this surface,
so the six equations are:
(p-c)*Nx=0; (p-c)*Ny=0; (p-c)*Nz=0;(p-c)*Nx=0; (p-c)*Ny=0; (p-c)*Nz=0;
#p is the point which we need to calculate, Nx Ny Nz are the normal vectors;
put p=e+td into equation then we can get t= (p-c)*N/d*N;
so we can get six points from six equation;
next we determine if the point P (the point which ray intersects cube) is within the cube;
if t >0 and t<x,y,z( x,y,z are the given cube sizeï¼‰ï¼Œ then p is within the cube.
