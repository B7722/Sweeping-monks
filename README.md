# Sweeping-monks
Ray Tracing development.

Meeting Note (28th Jan. 2018)
  1. Develop a GUI which asks users for the needed parameters to describe the 3D world. 
  2. Use python for backend programming.
  3. GUI saves all the input to a .dat file.
  4. Define more objects in the world, i.e. cude, cone, etc.
  5. Sample used eye-based tracing algorithm, we need to implement Photon Mapping for a better performance in image quality.
  6. Use multiple CPUs and/or GPU for acceleration.
