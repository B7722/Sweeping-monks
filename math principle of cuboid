//Fllowing is the math principle.

Firstly,there are two equations,
ray equation: p(t) = e + td;
the surface equation of the cuboid f (p) = 0.
when the when the ray intersects cuboid,
there is a point p which within the ray and the couboid at the same time,
then the point p must satisfy ray equation: p(t) = e + td and the surface equation f (p) = 0.
it means that f(p(t))=0 or (e+td)=0.

Secondly, we give the surface equation of the cuboid f (p) = 0 by mathematical method.
as we all know, cuboid has six surfaces, so there are six surface equations.
in mathematical method, we can use Normal vector and one 3D point to represent a surface,
and now in our modling, we give a 3D point c (x,y,z) as the origin of a 3D coordinate system,
our our cuboid is in this 3D coordinate system;
meanwhile, we give 3 vetors as the x,y,z axes of coordinate system and the normal vectors  for each surface of our cuboid.
then, the equations are:
(p-c)*Nx=0; 
(p-c)*Ny=0; 
(p-c)*Nz=0;
(p-c)*Nx=0; 
(p-c)*Ny=0;
(p-c)*Nz=0;

//p is the given point and the precise data need to be transmitted by the front end;
//The surface equation of the two opposing planes in the cuboid is the same one,
//because these two planes use the same normal vector and the same 3D point c.

next put ray equation p = e + td into the surface equation of the cuboid,
Through mathematical operations， we can get t= (p-c)*N/d*N.
accronding to this t, we can get the value of p(t) = e + td,
so we get  the 3D point p （within the ray) which we want to know if it is the point which is the intersection point.

Thirdly, we can find if this point p is within the surface of cubolid.
if t >0,
t<x,y,z;

//x,y,z are the given cube size，

then p is within the cube.
if not, 
p is not the Intersection point，
We can give up this point.


//explanation:
// The intersection principle of light with a cuboid and the principle of intersection principle of light with a cube are similar.
//The cube is the hexahedron which has the  smae data of length, width and height,
//and the cboid is the hexahedron which has the different data of length, width and height.
//So what we need to do is change parameters.
//Data is transmitted from the front end， we can change paramters from the given data.
//The step of changing the parameter needs the cooperation of front end and backend,
//So this step is not described in the modeling document.
